## 1. Project Overview
The goal of Lab 2 was to demonstrate proficiency in using **Front-end Frameworks**. I built a responsive **Tech Portfolio Landing Page** using **Bootstrap 5**, focusing on rapid development through utility classes rather than writing custom CSS.

## 2. Key Features
* **Modern Dark UI:** Fully implemented using Bootstrap's native dark mode (`bg-dark`, `text-light`) to create a sleek, professional look suitable for developers.
* **Responsive Grid System:**
    * **Desktop:** 3-column layout for the Project Gallery.
    * **Tablet:** 2-column layout for optimized readability.
    * **Mobile:** Stacked layout with a collapsible Navbar (Hamburger menu).
* **Component Usage:** utilized diverse Bootstrap components including Jumbotron (Hero), Cards, Progress Bars, and Forms.

## 3. Technical Implementation
This project strictly adheres to the "Framework-First" approach:

* **No Custom CSS (99%):** I minimized custom styling to prove mastery of Bootstrap's utility classes (e.g., `p-5`, `mb-4`, `d-flex`, `justify-content-center`).
* **CDN Integration:** Loaded Bootstrap CSS and JS bundles via CDN for performance optimization.
* **Semantic Structure:**
    * **Navbar:** `sticky-top` for easy navigation.
    * **Hero Section:** High-impact introduction with CTA buttons.
    * **Skills Section:** Visual representation of technical expertise using Progress Bars.
    * **Contact Form:** Clean layout with floating labels.

## 4. How to Run
1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Navigate to the `Lab2` directory.
3.  Open `index.html` in any modern browser.
    * *Note: Internet connection is required to load Bootstrap CDN resources.*
